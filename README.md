# UWB Based Smart Inventory Tracking

 UWB (Ultra-Wideband) Camera Tracking System aims to provide a technical solution to some of the problems in modern inventory tracking. The system is a cost-effective solution for tracking objects with a network of cameras. By using a UWB positioning system to track objects, positional data is sent to a multithreaded backend server system, which then directs a gimbal control system. This allows cameras to follow and monitor moving objects without the need for artificial intelligence or complicated image recognition software. Thus, the system has reduced computing power and eliminates the ambiguity associated with image recognition. Cameras can also be triggered to take and store photographs if objects enter or leave certain areas. All livestream footage and photographs are routed to a sophisticated and easy to use front end user Android application.
